# Face Recognition System using Eigenfaces
A face recognition system using algorithm called Eigenface and a benchmarking system to evaluate how accurate the system is in recognizing the faces according to the given dataset

## Features
This system can detect faces by treating the face recognition problem as a 2-D recognition problem. 
We project the set images into a face space known as eigenfaces. There are mainly 3 components in 
this system 
### 1) Image I/O and Visualization 
### 2) PCA for training 
### 3) Recognition by Nearest Neighbor classification. 
Eigenfaces is an algorithm that uses principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze face images and identify patterns (based on ears, eyes, mouth, nose) that represents 
a face.
